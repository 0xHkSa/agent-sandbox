## üöÄ The Master Plan

### **PHASE 1: Full Day Planner** ‚≠ê (START HERE)
**Goal:** Plan complete beach days with multi-stop itineraries

**Why This First:**
- Showcases MCP orchestration (multiple tools ‚Üí single output)
- Tangible "wow" factor for demos
- Foundation for all other features
- Can build in 2-3 hours

**What Gets Built:**

#### Backend (MCP Server)
- [ ] New tool: `planBeachDay()`
  ```typescript
  Input: {
    activity: "surf" | "family" | "relax" | "snorkel",
    skillLevel: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced",
    date: string,
    startTime: string,
    endTime: string,
    preferences: {
      avoidCrowds?: boolean,
      parkingRequired?: boolean,
      maxDriveTime?: number
    }
  }
  
  Output: {
    itinerary: [
      {
        time: "8:30 AM",
        duration: "3 hours",

## üéØ Development Principles

### 1. **Demo-Driven Development**
Every feature should have a clear demo script that makes normies go "holy shit"

### 2. **MCP Showcase First**
Always ask: "Does this show off MCP's orchestration power?"

### 3. **Progressive Complexity**
- Phase 1: Single tool ‚Üí result
- Phase 2: Multiple tools ‚Üí combined result
- Phase 3: Multiple tools + memory ‚Üí intelligent result
- Phase 4: Multiple tools + memory + external APIs ‚Üí magic

### 4. **Real Usage**
Build features YOU would actually use. If you won't use it, normies won't either.

## üí° Ideas Parking Lot

**Random Ideas to Explore Later:**
- Voice interface: "Hey Hawaii, plan my day"
- AR mode: Point camera at beach ‚Üí see live conditions overlay
- Surf forecast accuracy tracking: "Our predictions vs reality"
- Equipment recommendation engine
- Weather-based outfit suggestions
- Local events integration (concerts, markets, etc.)
- Sunset/sunrise photo opportunity predictor
- Historical "best day ever" tracker
- Compare beaches side-by-side
- "Surprise me" random adventure generator

---

## üìù Notes & Context

### Why This Project Exists
- Learn MCP architecture hands-on
- Build portfolio piece that showcases AI orchestration
- Create actually useful tool (not just demo)
- Explain complex tech to normies through working example

### Target Audience
1. **Primary:** Me (learning + personal use)
2. **Secondary:** Fellow nerds who want to understand MCP
3. **Tertiary:** Hawaii visitors who need activity planning
4. **Demo:** Wireless sales customers (show future of AI assistants)

### The Normie Test
If you can't explain what this does to a customer in 30 seconds and have them get excited, the feature isn't ready.

**Good:** "It plans your entire beach day by checking real-time conditions"  
**Bad:** "It uses MCP to orchestrate multiple API calls through Gemini"

### Keep Up or Get Left Behind
The tour guides who embrace AI tools will be unstoppable. The ones who resist will be replaced. Not by AI - by tour guides using AI.
